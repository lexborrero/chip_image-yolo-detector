# Chip Image Detector using YOLO

This repository contains a script to perform object detection specifically for **chip images**, using a YOLO model. It supports detecting objects in:

- single images  
- batches of images in a folder  
- video files  
- live camera (USB/FaceTime) input  

It has been modified to properly support the FaceTime HD camera on macOS by using the `AVFoundation` backend.
